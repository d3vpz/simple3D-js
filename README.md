# simple3D-js
A simple 3D engine for the canvas element in javascript, html, and css. Not really for practical use, just an easier way to add 3D graphics to your canvas.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

To install, you must have a canvas element in your html file named window. Note that it can be different, but you will have to change the variable in the engine to do so. Next, you want to type 
```
<script src="PATH TO drawing.js"></script>
```
Now you are free to create 3D objects in your canvas!
